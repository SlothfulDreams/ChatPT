    "question": "hi when I squat my hips inevitably move to the right side and when I jump my knee hurts what could possibly be the issue",
    "answer": "Based on the provided context, it's possible that you may be experiencing patellar tendonitis, also known as jumper's knee, which is characterized by pain in the band of tissue that connects the kneecap to the shin bone (Chunk 2, 5). The pain with jumping, running, or walking, especially downhill or downstairs, and pain with bending or straightening the leg, are consistent with the symptoms of patellar tendonitis (Chunk 2, 5).\n\nThe fact that your hips move to the right side when you squat may indicate an issue with your hip or leg alignment, which can contribute to patellar tendonitis (Chunk 5). Overpronation, where the arches of your feet collapse when you walk or run, can also lead to patellar tendonitis (Chunk 5).\n\nTo address the issue, you may want to consider exercises that strengthen the muscles around your knee, such as the quadriceps, hamstrings, and glutes (Chunk 3, 4). Additionally, you may want to work on improving your squat technique, including keeping your weight on your heels and engaging your core (Chunk 3). \n\nIt's also important to note that if you have knee pain, you should consult with a healthcare professional for proper diagnosis and treatment. They can help you develop a personalized exercise program and provide guidance on how to modify your activities to reduce stress on your knee.",
